# Agroland Style Guidelines

## Tone and Language
- Use clear, concise sentences with a friendly and professional tone.
- Avoid regional idioms, slang, or culturally specific references.
- Prefer active voice and direct statements.
- Use globally recognized spelling and terminology (e.g., "color" rather than locale-specific variants).
- Write in plain English suitable for an international audience.

## Formatting
- Use sentence case for headings and titles unless product names require otherwise.
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences) for readability.
- Use bullet lists for steps or key points.

## Content
- Highlight user benefits and practical outcomes.
- When referring to actions in the UI, use the exact labels shown on screen.
- Provide context for placeholders or dynamic text with translator comments when needed.

## Accessibility
- Provide descriptive alt text for images.
- Ensure links use meaningful text rather than generic phrases like "click here".

Adhering to these guidelines will help maintain a consistent Agroland voice across all content.
